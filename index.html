        <h3>Python Python Python</h3>
        <p>I started to do programming in the 90's. My first language was C++, not counting HTML of course. I used Pascal in my first job. I recently started to learn Python - and that language is now my new <strong>passion</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I started to learn web-development while the internet was still an infant. I learned HTML while everything there was to know fit in a very tiny book. I have always loved making websites, however I have always been more of a programmer than a designer. Admittedly I have fallen a bit behind, but I am trying to get current working on getting better at Javascript and CSS and also I am learning React.</p>
